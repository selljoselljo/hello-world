# hello-world

How are the trees and rivers and mountains?

My username is based on the nineties habit/fad of switching syllables in words.
I like the outdoors, but I am too cheap to get gear for camping and too lazy to get out of bed for anything other than work and food.
I like writing long sentences that could be mistaken for run on.
